            <h1>A little more about myself...</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Thanks for getting the time to know me. For a brief description about me, go to the <a href="../index.html">Home </a>Page. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born in 1990, and since I was a child I loved chemistry , so in 2009 I started Chemical Engineering in the University of Buenos Aires (U.B.A) and found out that I also loved thermodynamics. Hence, I studied VERY hard for 10 years to finally get my engineering degree in 2019. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While in college I learned about finite elements, advanced math, how computers manage data and to program in Turbo Pascal, but really didn't fall in love with coding. It was about 2018 when I started learning Python and realized I loved programming and its logic. I look forward to learn C and C++ so I have a better grip on low level coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2021 I "discovered" Javascript and Web Design, and I knew I had found my real vocation and started learning, first by myself and then through Coderhouse and their " Full Stack Web Developer" career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also discovered I wanted to be a Digital Nomad so I can travel the world with my girlfriend while doing what I love.
                </p>
                    I know I didn't have the shortest path to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer, but I'm really happy I found the career and the job I love doing :D.
                <p>
                    I hope you know what you want to do with your life, and if you don't, I REALLY hope you find it as I did.
